# MongoDB Local Setup and Basics (Document Database)

This document serves as a quick reference guide for setting up a local MongoDB instance using Docker and running basic document operations.

---

## 1. Local MongoDB Setup

MongoDB is a **Document Database** that stores data in flexible, JSON-like formats (**BSON**).

### 1.1 Start the MongoDB Container

This command runs the MongoDB server in the background, maps the default port (`27017`), and uses a Docker volume to ensure data persistence.

```bash
docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo
```

### 1.2 Access the MongoDB Shell (using mongosh)

You must use the modern shell client, mongosh, to interact with the server running inside the container.

```bash
docker exec -it mongodb mongosh
```

## 2. Core MongoDB Operations

Once connected to the **`mongosh`** prompt (`>`), you can run the following commands. The database engine will automatically create the database and collection when they are first used.

| Operation | Command | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Use/Create DB** | `use myNewDatabase` | Switches to (or creates) the specified database. |
| **Show Collections** | `show collections` | Lists all collections (similar to tables) in the current database. |
| **Insert Document** | `db.users.insertOne({ name: "Alice", city: "NYC", interests: ["hiking", "reading"] })` | Inserts a single document into the **`users`** collection. |
| **Find All** | `db.users.find()` | Retrieves all documents from the **`users`** collection. |
| **Find Filtered** | `db.users.find({ name: "Alice" })` | Retrieves documents matching the specified criteria. |
| **Update Field** | `db.users.updateOne({ name: "Alice" }, { $set: { city: "London" } })` | **Partially updates** the `city` field for the document where `name` is "Alice". |

## 3. Key Benefits of MongoDB

MongoDB's document-based structure provides significant advantages over traditional relational models. 

1.  **Flexible Schema (Schema-less):** Documents within the same **collection** do not need to share the same fields or structure, allowing for rapid iteration and application changes without mandatory database migration scripts.
2.  **Data Locality & No Joins:** Data is stored in **BSON** format. You can easily **embed arrays or nested documents** within a single document (e.g., an order document containing all line items). This eliminates the need for expensive **relational joins** at the application layer, leading to faster read operations.
3.  **Efficient Partial Updates:** MongoDB natively supports **partial updates** (using operators like `$set`), allowing you to modify a single field without rewriting the entire document, which improves write performance and reduces disk I/O.
